This is the code repository for [Building Serverless Microservices in Python](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/building-serverless-microservices-python?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789535297), published by Packt.

**A practical guide for developing end-to-end serverless microservices in Python for developers, DevOps, and architects.**

## What is this book about?
Over the last few years, there has been a massive shift from monolithic architecture to microservices, thanks to their small and independent deployments that allow increased flexibility and agile delivery. Traditionally, virtual machines and containers were the principal mediums for deploying microservices, but they involved a lot of operational effort, configuration, and maintenance. More recently, serverless computing has gained popularity due to its built-in autoscaling abilities, reduced operational costs, and increased productivity.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Discover what microservices offer above and beyond other architectures 
* Create a serverless application with AWS 
* Gain secure access to data and resources 
* Run tests on your configuration and code 
* Create a highly available serverless microservice data API 
Build, deploy, and run your serverless configuration and code

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
  "phoneNumbers": [
    {
      "type": "home",
      "number": "212 555-1234"
    },
    {
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If you are a developer with basic knowledge of Python and want to learn how to build, test, deploy, and secure microservices, then this book is for you. No prior knowledge of building microservices is required.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-).
